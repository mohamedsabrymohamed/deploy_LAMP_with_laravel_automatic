Deploy LAMP Stack and Laravel project to empty server with one command

From this script you can deploy LAMP Stack and Laravel Project with apache configurations with only one command.<br>

All you will need will be:<br>
1- Download this sell script to your empty server.<br>
2- chmod 777 laravel_auto.sh <br>
3- ./laravel_auto.sh to run the script<br>
4- Enter project name you want to be created under /var/www/html/<br>

You will only need to insert Enter when PHP Package is needed to be installed then enter your prefered MYSQL password you will need.<br>

For now it's working only with Ubuntu 16.4 and will add more OS to it.

This Script is only in beta more scripts and advanced ones will be attached.<br>

Thanks.
